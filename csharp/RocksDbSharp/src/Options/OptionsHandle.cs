    Configure options for a RocksDb store.

    Note on SetXXX() syntax:
       Why not syntax like new Options { XXX = ... } instead?  Two reasons
       1. The rocksdb C API does not support reading the options and so a class with properties is not an appropriate representation
       2. The API functions are named as imperatives and don't always begin with "set" so one like "OptimizeLevelStyleCompaction" wouldn't work right
